# Principle

Pneumatic artificial muscles, also known as McKibben muscles, are actuators comparable to biological muscles, the principle of which was proposed in the 1950s by Joseph McKibben. They are capable of contraction, meaning that when activated, they change from an initial resting elongation to a reduced elongation.

The two main components of these muscles are, on one hand, an air chamber whose volume can be varied, and on the other, a braided fiber sleeve whose diameter can be changed. By placing the air chamber inside the braiding, its inflation causes the diameter of the braiding to widen and the two ends to move closer together: contraction!

This type of actuator is used in many fields, including robotics, prosthetics, and exoskeletons. They are appreciated for their lightness, low cost, and ability to generate significant forces.



# Construction

To create a pneumatic artificial muscle, you need an air chamber, a braided fiber sleeve, a pneumatic connector, and a compressed air source. For this project, I used a silicone tube as the air chamber. The entire equipment is shown below.

The first step was to construct the air chamber. For this, I attached an air inlet to one end of the silicone tube and sealed the other end. The resulting assembly is shown below.

I then added the braided fiber sleeve around the air chamber, securing its ends with hose clamps. The pneumatic artificial muscle is then ready to be used:
