<a href="https://github.com/Rhoban/bam" target="_blank">This repository</a> contains the implementation of extended friction models for the physical simulation of servo actuators. The proposed models significantly reduce the sim-to-real gap, which is particularly important in reinforcement learning. The models are tested on 2R arms for validation. A method to use these models with MuJoCo is also provided.
