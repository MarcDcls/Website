# Fuller's Projections

The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dymaxion_map" target="_blank"> Fuller's projections </a> are cartographic projections of the Earth's map onto regular polygonal surfaces. Applied in 1946 to a cuboctahedron and in 1954 to an icosahedron, these projections are called the *Dymaxion map*, from ***dy****namic* ***max****imum tens****ion***. They have the advantage of reducing cartographic distortions present in classical projections such as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mercator_projection" target="_blank"> Mercator </a> or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gall%E2%80%93Peters_projection" target="_blank"> Peters </a>, for example. In fact, it is impossible to project a shape drawn on a sphere onto a plane without distortion. As a result, the relative sizes of countries are never accurately represented on a map. The website <a href="https://www.thetruesize.com" target="_blank"> TheTrueSize </a> allows users to visualize the actual relative sizes of countries compared to one another.

The projection used for the Dymaxion Globe is an icosahedral projection, meaning it is mapped onto a regular polygon composed of 20 equilateral triangles. This is the same shape used for 20-sided dice. It is important to note that Fuller's projections are not unique.

# Manufacturing

The idea and the original design come from a project hosted on Thingiverse, which you can check out <a href="https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:1871829" target="_blank"> here </a>. After modifying the vector design, we arrived at the following image, ready to be laser-cut.

After cutting, two versions were assembled. A smaller version, approximately 15 cm in diameter, without meridians or parallels, and a larger version, approximately 25 cm in diameter, featuring meridians and parallels.
